A someday-to-be program for converting roman/medieval dates into conventional
formats written by Ilia Alexander Kurenkov.

DESCRIPTION
At this point in time this is not exactly a program, more a collection of files
and modules that I plan to combine later on. The purpose of this program [in
the future] is to find instances of roman/medieval dates in documents and
convert them into conventional dates.

The program started out merely as an excercise to keep me from forgetting how
to code. I am placing it on github in order to a) keep track of my changes,
because I am at a stage where recovery/traceback can be quite tedious and b) to
get some practice with github in along the way.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
All of the files in this program were created using Python 2.7.
No modules or methods are used that are very unique or specific to that version
of Python, so everything should work fine on any installation of Python on any
machine.
